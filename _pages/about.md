I'm a PhD student at [Cambridge machine learning group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) (started in autumn 2019), supervised by [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [José Miguel Hernández Lobato](https://jmhl.org/).

I'm interested in large-scale machine learning, time- and memory-efficient deep learning. In particular, I'm interested in Transformer neural networks and how to improve them. Check my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iiVVfxUAAAAJ&hl=en) page for a list of publications and preprints.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (Dostoevsky and Tolstoy are my favourite authors) and running to free my head of machine learning thoughts. I also love drawing and visual arts: I considered a career in CG art, but machine learning won.
