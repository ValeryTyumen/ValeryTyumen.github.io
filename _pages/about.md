I'm a PhD student at [Cambridge machine learning group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) (started in autumn 2019), supervised by [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [José Miguel Hernández Lobato](https://jmhl.org/).

I'm interested in large-scale machine learning, time-, memory-efficient deep learning and efficient algorithms. In particular, I'm interested in Transformer networks and how to improve them, but also beyond that. My CV and publications can be found on this website.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (Dostoevsky and Tolstoy are among my favourite authors), running, drawing in a sketchbook and also recently tennis, yoga and dancing.
